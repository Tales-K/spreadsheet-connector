# spreadsheet-connector

Create a site using React.js with the porpouse of checking if two spreadsheets matches with manual verification

We should render two "upload" button that accepts a CSV, one on the left and other on the right of the screen, centered in each side

The user will then click it and select a csv.

Then it will display the csv on the respective side of the screen. Each CSV should have the option of sort by any column, if there are too many columns, there must be a horizontal scroll so one csv always uses half of the available horizontal space.

After each line of the CSV there should be a round dot centered with the line. When clicked and draged, a curved line will appear from the start point and the user will drop it on one life of the other table, connecting one row of a table to the other row of another table. When two lines are connected, they must turn into olive green.

Use libraries if available for handling the csv processing and displaying, also for the click and drag.
